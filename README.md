# TaskHUD

Simple interface to TaskWarrior using `ncurses`

## Objectives

* Configurable, but usable out of the box
* Doesn't require you to memorize loads of keybindings
* Provides extended history and metadata for tasks that the standard JSON
  export interface doesn't provide

## Development Status

Just prototyping for now
